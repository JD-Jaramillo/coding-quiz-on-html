## HTML


## CSS



## JS 
Created a series of prompts that if validated by the user than run through a loop several times (until the length of characters that the user requested is reached). After passing through this loop and being filtered out to remove the 'undefined' characters the charaters are then added to the password variable which is then in turn sent to the next fucntion which writes this password in the text area for the user to see.
